Haystack provides a fuzzy matching algorithm for use by other Vim plugins.  It's based on flx for Emacs but adapted to my own real world experience.  The algorithm gives priority to runs of consecutive letters and letters after punctuation marks.

So far, out of the box support is included with projectionist.vim (vimscript #4989), including dependent plugins like rails.vim (vimscript #1567).
